I received a letter in the mail, stating that Experian received my correspondence and found it to be "" suspicious '' and that "" I did n't write it ''. Experian 's letter is worded to imply that I am incapable of writing my own letter. I was deeply offended by this implication. 
I called Experian to figure out why my letter was so suspicious. I spoke to a representative who was incredibly unhelpful, She did not effectively answer any questions I asked of her, and she kept ignoring what I was saying regarding the offensive letter and my dispute process. I feel the representative did what she wanted to do, and I am not satisfied. It is STILL not clear to me why I received this letter. I typed this letter, I signed this letter, and I paid to mail this letter, yet Experian willfully disregarded my lawful request. 
I am disgusted with this entire situation, and I would like for my dispute to be handled appropriately, and I would like for an Experian representative to contact me and give me a real explanation for this letter.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

2037,"I am writing to request your assistance in looking into the deceptive practices of this collection law-firm above. It appears that they are using tactics that may be violating consumer protection law in debt collection practices depriving consumers of their rights to dispute. 

1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). 

2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. 

3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. 

4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. 

5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. 

The company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. 

Facts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. 
2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. 
4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. 
5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons.

I was assured my application was in their system and being processed, and Fedloan services person even confirmed they had my income verification documents showing I made around {$16000.00}, and would pay XXXX on an IBR plan. All I had to do was pay a {$5.00} fee to place the loan back on the payment plan. They said I should allow 3 weeks for them to "" process '' my plan, even though they literally had every piece of information in front of them. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a letter informing me they were missing documentation of my income, which makes no sense, because the woman over the phone was able to tell me my income 4 days earlier. when I called Fedloan services they tell me I need to fill out a paper application for the IBR plan, and submit paper copies of my income verification which directly contradicts everything they told the ombudsman, and everything it says on both their website and XXXX. why do they even have an app with income verification tools if you need to send a paper application as well? 

I believe this company removed me from my plan in the first place in order to threaten me with fraudulent back payments. since early XXXX I have been trying to have my IBR plan processed, which is supposed to take less than 2 weeks and it is taking over 2 months. I have had to reapply for the IBR XXXX separate times now in 2 months, and have gone onto forbearence twice and Fedloan services has instructed me at every turn to fill out another form or send something in, or wait 3 weeks for somethings to be processed. 

This entire time I have been living on an income of less than {$900.00} per month, working part time, and I can prove all of this. So I am well below the threshold for an IBR plan, and they even told me over the phone that I was eligible for {$0.00} payments. there is no excuse for them to be dragging their feet except to force me out of the IBR plan and into a plan where they can collect more money for not processing my information. 

I am still actively trying to pursue this matter with the ombudsman and Fedloan services, but I want to enter a formal complaint with the CFPB, as the behavior of my loan servicer has been dishonest and ( purposely! ) confusing, slow and incompetent to throw people like me into default so they can make more money off of fees.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

2052,"My complaint is n't about phone calls, but I believe "" communication tactics '' was the closest to my complaint. My main problem is with the Debt Collection Company, the lesser complaint is with the school. 

I 'm currently in a dispute with my local community college regarding a small debt, either {$49.00} or {$79.00}, depending who I speak to. In XX/XX/XXXX I took XXXX XXXX XXXX classes and paid upfront with my credit card. One of the classes was canceled, and I was refunded the money for it. XX/XX/XXXX I received in the mail a small slip of paper saying in part : "" Dear XXXX, Please be advised you have a past due balance with XXXX for a XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ... Pay by XX/XX/XXXX '' It did not look like a bill or invoice and my name was not on the slip or the amount owed. I called the college that day and spoke to someone who could n't tell me what class I owed for or provide any of the normal information that one would find on a bill or invoice. The woman I spoke to promised she would do research and get back to me, which never happened. 

I must point out, that I 've never been a matriculated student at this college or had a student loan. I registered and paid for XXXX XXXX classes in XX/XX/XXXX, attended XXXX, the XXXX was canceled, and the money for that class refunded. Also, the paperwork seems to indicate this "" debt '' was for something in XX/XX/XXXX, and I never registered for or attended ANY classes in XXXX. When I got the notice from the debt collector, I called the contact for the college on that notice and failed to receive any meaningful information that would indicate I owed them money. The woman was "" too busy '' to explain it other than to say that XXXX people in her department looked at the paperwork and agreed I owed them money. I responded that they should send me a proper invoice if they have such paperwork. 

At any rate, they sent this alleged debt to AR Resources Inc., and their first contact with me by mail, they sent the notice to an old address. The address is from at least 25 years ago or more. The XXXX college does not have this address on their records, so I believe AR Resources Inc deliberately used an absurdly old address so I would n't get the notice. The reason I got the notice, despite the old address, is because I still live in my home town and people in the Post Office know me and where I live currently. 

I can not stress strongly enough that AR Resources Inc had to deliberately do EXTENSIVE research to find this address. It 's not a simple clerical error. The house number they used was from the pre-XX/XX/XXXX era. Not before XX/XX/XXXX, but literally before my town had XXXX service, you know?

2119,"Hello, I have been a victim of Identity theft on multiple occasions since 2012 and have reported this to many government agencies including the FTC, IRS, XXXX Police and more. As a result my information has been misused fraudulently and there were charges incurred by parties unknown to me on several occasions on many of my accounts and I have been working relentlessly to remedy the negative effects of this. Almost ALL of the creditors and reporting agencies have done their own investigations and come to the realization that I have indeed been victimized, and most have cleared up their files. 

The one outrageous entity remaining, is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, CA, and their XXXX Collector, XXXX XXXX , who not only refuses to accept the numerous documentation and disputes I have submitted thru the past several years, but also keeps adding {$10000.00} to the fictitious amount they have been reporting ( over {$30000.00} ) each time I dispute their ridiculous charade! Their attempts to pressure the consumer by intimidation are beyond reason! Their lack of willingness to examine the evidence and come to the conclusions that everyone else has, seems like a sinister ordeal! Furthermore, this is all on a corporate account that I was associated with as one of the managers! Where is the Original Instrument of debt? Why are they pursuing me when they have no other recourse? 

Their Ref. # is : XXXX / XXXX ( original Creditor of record ) file number is XXXX The corporation in question was XXXX XXXX XXXX which was owned by some other corporation, ALL of which are dissolved. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX info is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX . XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Contact : XXXX XXXX, XXXX Collector Ph. XXXX Fax : XXXX They continue to disregard the fact that XXXX HAS acknowledged that there was indeed fraudulent activity, unauthorized account ( s ) and unauthorized use of my information ( XXXX file # XXXX ), and that we have always continued to dispute their report, and said balances and amounts repeatedly. In fact, the representatives from XXXX ( and on a separate occasion, an IRS agent ) are the ones who informed me about the fraudulent activities, and I was unaware of this and the extent of it previous to that! 
Further, the above referenced claim is on a corporate account, and that company was owned by yet XXXX other corporations, all of which have been dissolved and out of business for several years. Simply having been point of contact, or having made any good faith efforts to resolve this while investigating the information does not constitute acceptance of liability by me personally, nor an agreement to the accuracy of the information reported by said collection company in any way. 
Initially, XXXX notified us of fraudulent activity, the IRS investigated and notified me of falsified Tax reports under my information and fixed it and recommended putting a Fraud Alert on my file. Police, FTC and other authorities were notified and reports were filed and Credit Freeze/Alerts were put in place. Since then, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and several other institutions have investigated and acknowledge this and ALL have corrected their records. Yet they refuse to comply despite having been provided with ample documentation to that effect and several letters of dispute! 
I have continuously disputed the information, and any personal liability in this matter. That position has not changed, and I demand - once again - that this be corrected and struck from any consumer reports. I am attaching some of the aforementioned supporting documents, and there more available upon request. I appreciate your attention to this matter!

I have maintained a XXXX for over 25 years and I never ignored my financial obligations, but after I was XXXX I requested the SCRA financial protection from my creditors and my all creditors began filing adverse credit reports, increased the interest rates, closed all of my accounts within 4 months and reported I had requested the closures. I had been making my payments and have had to document my payments and disputed the information for years, but the Credit Reporting Agencies always said the creditor has verified the information. Equifax has provided my credit information to the XXXX and based on that information, the XXXX intended to terminate my ability to maintain my XXXX while I was XXXX in XXXX. This has resulted in me being unqualified to continue working in my field of expertise, as I had for the past 25 years. I have found evidence that Equifax has been re-aging the original accounts reported by my creditors and this is the negative account information that was provided to the XXXX. Accounts that transferred or sold from one debt collector to another, and the date of first activity on the accounts make the delinquency look more resent, the dates of the first delinquency should not change. The date of first delinquency determines how long a negative account can remain on your credit reports and a negative credit item, such as a charge-off can only remain on my credit report for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. Section 623 ( 5 ) ( A ) says : "" In general. A person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding a delinquent account being placed for collection, charged to profit or loss, after furnishing the information, notify the agency of the date of delinquency on the account, which shall be the month and year of the commencement of the delinquency on the account that immediately preceded the action. '' This means that if a debt collector reports a date of first delinquency to the credit bureaus and the original creditor previously reported it, the dates must be the same date of first delinquency. Any different date constitutes illegal re-aging. This re-aging of my accounts has cause serious damage to my credit files, I 'm hoping that this will be corrected quickly since I am provided my previous credit reports as attachments as evidence of the original dates of the first delinquency reported. The Credit Report I received from Equifax would be empty if not for the re-aging of the remaining accounts on your credit report, because the FCRA requires that information reported be in compliance with the date of first delinquency and the name of the party who reported the date of first delinquency.

XXXX does n't have the legal right to deny mt SCRA request without first having a court order granting them the right not to comply with the Federal Statutes of the SCRA Financial protections and the SCRA Interest Rate provision requires a creditor not to accelerate the account for non payments of the obligation until the SCRA requirements are in compliance, ignoring my SCRA request is n't permitted without a court order and the attorney should have known.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

My daughter 's attempts to refinance this note have been ignored and at one point a rep told her they would just get the money from me - my credit cards had plenty of room as she could see it right there in my credit report. My daughter just gave birth to her XXXX child who has a XXXX which requires XXXX. Her other XXXX children are XXXX and under. Her husband is the sole support for the family. After numerous calls with Navient and letters I called them as I had a letter that a settlement was possible- first the rep denied that was what the letter said. I offered a much lesser amount stating the funds were coming out of a small retirement account. The rep finally said she was authorized to settle for $ XXXX. When I replied this was beyond my means and could she do better after a long argument, she transferred me to a supervisor. The supervisor said she knew nothing of my call before I was transferred and proceeddd to bully me about my daughter 's note. I continued to state I wanted to find a way to settle the note that my daughter could not repay it and I could not afford to pay another bill. The tactics used are nothing short of bullying, then they roll to empathy and back to bullying. This representative told me Navient would never settle and that I could pay {$5000.00} to get my name off the loan. Forty five minutes later and exhausted I just excused myself to get back to work. The rep left me with a threatening remark about forwarding me to collections. Navient is now calling my work number at least once a week. They call my cell phone daily and they send letters in envelopes with no return address. My daughter suffers the same harassment and they are now even calling her mother-in-law. My complaint is that my daughter was n't informed on the impact of deferring her loan. They 've refused to work with her on an income based plan. While I accept responsibility for signing the loans I would expect after 12 years and all the interest already collected, Navient would make an effort to refinance this note instead of using scare tactics.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

I set up automatic withdraws from my checking account and had paid faithfully since I became aware of the loan. 
I was leaving to go on a mission trip in XXXX XX/XX/2016 so I made certain that my payment arrangements would still be taken out of my account while I was out of the country because I knew that I would be unable to have constant internet connection during my trip in remote areas. I also had budgeted my finances accordingly to make sure I had available funds in my account to cover my monthly payments of {$87.00}. 
Unfortunately, while abroad I had to have an emergency XXXX operation which caused me to have a month long hospital stay in XXXX, XXXX. There were many complications with my XXXX and my right XXXX was not functional for several weeks post operation. I had to learn to walk again not to mention I was dealing with my travel insurance who was refusing to pay my covered expenses. 
I wrote an email to XXXX letting them know that I was abroad and going through a tough time. In my email I asked if I could postpone my payments or lower them while I was recovering in the hospital, could figure out what was going on with my insurance and make it back to the United States. They replied to me via email stating that I needed to call them at a specific number never mentioning anything about adjusting my payment arrangement. 
At this time I did n't have a data plan, was unable to independently walk or get out of bed and had limited WiFi connectivity. I messaged my father to call XXXX on my behalf and explain the situation. My father had all of my information to make such a call but XXXX refused to disclose any information or take note of what was going on. 
3 Days after I received correspondence from XXXX I had a friend check my available balance and XXXX had withdrawn the entire amount of my payment agreement for that month. I assumed that since no one was able to make contact or confirm that there would be changes made to my payment arrangements that the full amount would be withdrawn each month. 
It was a very difficult time after my emergency XXXX with medications, learning how to walk again and dealing with insurance and physical therapy. Around XXXX and a half months after I was XXXX from the hospital I started to have more complications which caused me to be re-hospitalized again in XXXX. Luckily this time I was well enough to make the trip back to the XXXX to have a second emergency XXXX XXXX which I am in the progress of recovering from currently. 
Upon returning to the XXXX, my Uncle who cosigned for the loan contacted me and said that XXXX were harassing him with rude phone calls and threats of being sued because I had defaulted on my loan. I was shocked at this news. I checked my account and saw that XXXX had stopped withdrawing my payments. I called XXXX to figure out what happened and it took 2 months of me calling and asking until they finally admitted they had stopped the payments. When I asked why, the rep said because I had asked them to in an email. I was never notified that they made XXXX changes to my payment arrangement or the stipulations of said changes. This has hurt mine and my XXXX 's credit negatively and we are still receiving harassing phone calls daily.

I contacted XXXX and explained that the little box had somehow gotten lost in the moves.They said that I owed them {$100.00} dollars for the box. I explained to XXXX that it was an honest mistake and due to me having to move twice in two months, that it was an mistake in which I had ultimately no control over the situation being that the movers were moving me and I explained that I could not afford to pay for the box and that since I was a loyal customer for four years I felt that they should have honored my reasons. I was never again contacted by XXXX. About a year later I began receiving harassing telephone calls from a collection agency stating that they represented XXXX and that they were trying to collect {$120.00}. I asked them what for and they said I owed them money for the lost box. I explained to the collection agency what the situation was and why I did not feel that I should be held responsible for a little lost box and that mistakes happen. I told them that I was filing a complaint. I recently reviewed my credit report and found that I have a collection item reported by the collection agency who supposedly was representing XXXX. I feel that this wrong being that XXXX never contacted me again nor tried to call and discuss the situation and for them to do this is really bad business after I had a legitimate and very logical reason for the issue. I would never deliberately NOT send a little box back to a company for no good reason. I think what XXXX did was wrong and I do not feel that I owe them anything.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I pulled a copy of my tri-merge credit report as my husband and I are preparing to purchase a home. I found a collection from this company on my credit report. They were not reporting the original creditor or the date of last activity, so I sent a dispute letter to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. All XXXX credit bureaus reported the account as having been verified by XXXX. XXXX XXXX I sent a dispute letter to XXXX directly asking that they validate this debt. They did not respond. On XXXX XXXX I sent another dispute to the company and did not receive a response. On XXXX XXXX I sent yet another dispute to the company advising them that they were in violation of the FDCPA by failure to respond. I did receive a response to this letter ... ... .with a judgment notice attached. 

When I looked at the filed judgment, which is not yet reporting on my credit report, I saw that Midland states that they sent judgment paperwork to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, an address I have not lived in for three years. I have moved twice since living at that address and each time I updated my address with the DMV, my creditors and filed a mail forwarding with the post office. In addition, I have had the same phone number for ten years and did not receive one phone call from Midland regarding this debt. 

I now know who they are attempting to collect for, an account that was charged off in XX/XX/XXXX yet Midland is reporting the date of last activity as XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please understand I am not trying to get out of my obligations to pay my debts. In XX/XX/XXXX I had moved to XXXX when offered position with a company. Within one week of moving to XXXX I discovered that I was pregnant. I started my new job and, after about a month of sitting in an office doing absolutely nothing and consistently asking the owners what their marketing strategy was, how I could help to bring in clients, etc. I was told that the company was a debt settlement company interested only in settling the debts of their clients then forwarding those clients to me for counseling. However, the clients were not interested in the extra fee for this service and the department was closed, leaving me without a job. My husband 's income covered our rent, food and utilities. We had no extra money. I was able to obtain another job but as soon as I did, my husband lost his job. 

At six month of XXXX we were told our baby had a XXXX and an XXXX. We were sent for further testing, I was put on medication that did regulate the baby 's XXXX, however, the XXXX did not correct itself. We decided, at nine months XXXX, to come home to XXXX where our family and friends were. We had gone through our savings making these XXXX large moves in under a year, we had no money. We stayed with a friend. When the baby was born he was born healthy, but we relied on a friend to provide the baby with clothing and diapers. We were on XXXX and food stamps. We could not afford to pay the bills. 

We did start to get back on our feet and my husband was able to find work. This covered rent for our own apartment and a room for the baby. Unfortunately the baby was not reaching his milestones and at XXXX months old was diagnosed with XXXX. Since then we have been in XXXX, fighting for services and trying to help our son develop and reach his goals. At almost XXXX years old he is still XXXX. But we are getting there ... .slowly but surely.

I called them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. They informed me it was for the Capital One Credit Card that had a balance of about XXXX. We settled on a payment of XXXX. I made the payment over the phone at that time using my debit card. I requested that proof of payment be sent to me via email at the time and they stated that it was a process and they would get the process started within 48 hours. Two days later I called to get an update on the proof of payment and they stated that they would send it out. This went on for about three weeks and they still never sent the proof of payment. They verbally reassured me that the file was closed and that they reported it to the Credit Bureaus. 

In XXXX of XXXX, over one year after I had made the payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received notice from XXXX County Magistrate Court that a Judgement was granted to XXXX. I was stunned being that I had already paid it. I called XXXX XXXX and let them know that they needed to correct this. At this point the judgement was appearing on my credit report. In late XXXX of XXXX I received a Certificate Of Service stating that the Judgement was satisfied on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This was well over a year after the payment was made.

I called XXXX XXXX and they stated that the file is closed and that they can not do anything about it. I kept calling and the sent me to the voicemail of their attorney ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that was handling the case. He still has not called me back. 

Today I called XXXX XXXX and they told me to go to the Magistrate Court and ask them to help me. When I went down there the clerk said that they can not do anything and that it was already filed. 

XXXX XXXX refuses to help and take the proper steps to correct the mistake that they have made. I have been hung up on, put on hold until I got tired and hung up and been sent to eronious voicemails. These people are very aggressive in obtaining payment but once the payment is made they do not honor their word and make sure that the file is properly closed out.

He offered his advise to refinance at a lower interest rate ( currently at 11.25 % ) or suggested that the borrower and myself pay-off the loan. 

It is my understanding that an interest reduction plan should be for that period of time and after that plan is complete, the consumer should n't get penalized for the plan by adding the lost interest back to the loan.

I messaged Navient 's live online messaging service on XX/XX/XXXX to explain the problem and the rep. told me that they were looking into it and that it should be reallocated by the following week.

2472,"While I have tried to get AES to see reason ( see attached letter ) they are insisting on maintaining their slanderous position with the credit reporting agencies. As AES 's false statements are of a civil nature, I would have to take them to court, incurring substantial cost, in order to force them to report fairly and honestly. However, as the federal agency charged with protecting citizens from having lies and slanderous information reported on their credit reports, I implore you to force the credit agencies to strike all false information from my credit report. 

As anyone with eyes can see, these are XXXX invoices consisting of multiple consolidated loans against each. To report that I missed XXXX and XXXX payments, respectively, instead of XXXX payments total, is a lie and a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

As the credit reporting agencies always seem to take the side of the reporting company ( which, I understand, pays a fee in order to report credit information ), citizens such as myself look to the Federal Credit Reporting Agency to protect us from what amounts to a monopoly on credit information, which we have extremely limited control over. 

Where is the equity in the system when XXXX missed payments can drop a credit score from XXXX to XXXX ( more than XXXX points ), especially when the payments were missed due to lack of a monthly billing being sent by eh creditor. 



This letter concerns late payments made by me for the reference ( XXXX ) and ( XXXX ) accounts, which are for the following Loan Sequences, respectively : Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX Loan Sequences : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX XXXX XXXX Loan Sequences : XXXX XXXX While I admit that the XXXX 2015 payments for these accounts was made more than 30 days late, I did not receive a bill for XXXX. While I agree that I still would be responsible to make the payment, like most people, I pay my bills when I receive notification in the mail that it is due. 

When I called to dispute the information you reported to the credit bureaus, and informed them of the above, they advised that the XXXX billings for both accounts was sent out, according to your records. That XXXX be, but I did not receive them. I was also informed that I could set up automatic deductions from my bank accounts. I declined, as, due to identity theft concerns, I do not have any automatic deductions from my bank account. 

Once this error was made clear to me, I made sure that both accounts were up to date, as they are now. 

During the call, your representative indicated that she did not have the authority to remove the derogatory information from my credit report. She also stated that it was not legal to remove derogatory information from a credit report, which is not true. 

The derogatory information that AES reported to the credit bureaus is both unfair and in accurate. It is unfair because, as stated above, I did not receive a XXXX 2015 billing. It is inaccurate because it reports XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX late payments, when in fact there were only XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As shown above, and as detailed in the attachments, I only have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts with AES. These accounts represent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Sequences, respectively, but they are not separate payments. Because this false derogatory information was reported to the credit bureaus, my credit score dropped XXXX points overnight. This represents slander, and resulting harm. 

Based on the above, I demand that AES remove the false, inaccurate and slanderous derogatory information from by credit reports. If this is not done within XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX days, I will initiate legal action against AES and the credit bureaus for slander, with appropriate demands for monetary damages. 

I strongly advise you to take immediate action as directed herein.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

2474,"I used to live in Campus Habitat Apartments for 3 years from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The place was filthy disgusting and consistently was being bought out by a new management company every few months. They also had buildings with condemned apartments in them and almost were shut down due to how disgusting they are. 

A few months before our lease ended, our kitchen started to leak water from somewhere. We did n't know if it was dishwasher, sink what it was but it got to the point that we had about XXXX-XXXX inches of standing water in our kitchen. We made numerous phone calls to the office asking for someone to come take care of it and they refused. We let them know that if they did not take care of it we would not pay rent until they did. So we lived there for 2 months without paying rent and the problem never being fixed. Our apartment continuing to leak water all over the kitchen every time we cleaned it up again. When we moved out, we went to the office to hand in our keys and let them know that we did not clean up all the towels and stuff we had on the floor due to the water damage because it was not our fault and we were disgusted. We also let them know that the rent would not be paid for that because part of our lease states they were to respond to maintenance requests and they never did so since they did n't hold up their end of the lease agreement, we would not pay. We lived with a flooded kitchen and disgusting smell of molded wet towels barely even able to cook or pack up in our kitchen. I gave them the address to our new apartment for my security deposit and such and left. 

1 year later I go to apply to a new complex with my boyfriend and I find that I am declined. When I ask why they state it was because I owe money to XXXX XXXX and that it 's on my credit report. This comes as a shock to me as I had moved out of that apartment over a year ago and have never received a phone call, letter, invoice nothing stating that I owed any money to them. I knew that I had refused to pay rent for 2 months but since they never sent anything to me asking for payment nor contacted me about it on the phone, I assumed they let it go as they were wrong by not making my apartment XXXX livable and I could take them to court over it. So I contacted them after looking at my credit report and seeing that on XX/XX/XXXX they placed me with a collections agency regarding my past due money. When I contacted them I asked what besides my rent they were trying to claim I owed them, as my rent was not enough to equate to {$1100.00} at all. They claimed I owed for some damages, repainting and re-carpeting and such as well because they had no record of anyone 's move in sheets that were filled out 3 years prior since they company had been bought out by so many different new management companies during that time. They also could not provide me with a written statement or invoice for a breakdown of the charges they told me just to come in and write a check. At this point it was also yet another company that owned them than what it was when I moved out. I expressed that I wanted a manager to call me back immediately to dispute this because it was absolutely obscene and I never received a phone call. To this day, I still have not received a phone call, written notice or invoice. Somehow they also could not explain why I never received a security deposit back or why that did not pay towards the balance. And I also now see that the complex themselves not only has YET ANOTHER new management company but they have an entirely new name for the apartments. I do not know who to contact to get this account off my credit report as a negative mark. I do n't know if I have to take them to small claims to dispute it and show them pictures of the disgusting hallways and apartments and condemned buildings with broken locks and all this information.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

2476,"I was delinquent in paying a debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for an emergency ambulance ride. Incidentally, I did call the Fire Department directly shortly after the date of service and attempted to pay over the phone. At that time, they did not have an electronic system in place to accept payment via debit/credit card and requested that I send in a check, which I did not do. I called back last month and attempted to pay the debt directly to them and they advised that they had already sent the account to collections with National Business Factors. 
As the debt was sent to National Business Factors , Inc., I was contacted via writing by them. Within ten days of receiving their collection letter, I contacted National Business Factors , Inc. directly and paid the original debt in its entirety. I refused to pay the interest as I did not enter into a contract with National Business Factors , Inc. and felt I had paid the bill completely. The bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was for {$350.00} and on XXXX/XXXX/2015, this amount was paid to National Business Factors , Inc. 
I continued ( and still do ) to receive phone calls and letters from the collection agency threatening to ruin my credit if I do not pay the interest, which they report continues to accrue daily. 
I have contacted the collection agency on numerous occasions citing my belief that legally I do no owe this debt as I have not entered into a contract with them, therefore they can not charge me this interest. I have consulted the internet and state laws to learn that I am not legally responsible for this debt. They are aggressive with me when I attempt to communicate with them and continue to threaten my credit worthiness. 
The amount in question is only {$25.00}, though that compounds daily so is likely higher at this point. I am protesting out of principle, certainly not out of inability to pay the amount. I disagree with their collections tactics and do n't feel I owe this debt. 
Is it legal for a XXXX party collection agency to hold me responsible to them for their interest after the debt has already been paid off completely? And continue to compound the debt after the original debt has been paid?

When I was in disagreement with her statement and indicated that the credit bureau was informing me otherwise, she transferred me to her manager, XXXX. 

When XXXX answered the phone, asking how he could help me, I had stated that they ( IQ Data International XXXX were indicating that they were not reporting a balance owed to the credit bureau. He interrupted me before I could finish the next sentence to tell me that this is incorrect, that they are not reporting derogatory information to the credit bureaus. Yes, you read that correctly. He disagreed with my statement by stating exactly what I said in a different combination of words. I immediately requested that he please listen to what I am saying because it was clear he was n't listening to anything I just said. He began laughing. Although I was rather disconcerted, I attempted to move on by informing him what the credit bureau has claimed. He interrupted me and began speaking over me, despite my request to not interrupt me while I am speaking. I asked him again to not interrupt me and to listen to what I had to say and he responded maliciously and hung up. This is not acceptable professional behavior. 

It still stands that the credit bureaus are indicating that IQ Data International is reporting this derogatory information on my credit file. These are the facts. If IQ Data International is legitimately claiming they filed the appropriate paperwork to the credit bureaus, then they need to be contacting the bureaus and disputing this with them directly, as I can not be a middle person when the representatives of IQ Data International choose to disrespect me and disconnect the line intentionally.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

XXXX is XXXX XXXX, Utah XXXX. I kept a close eye on the XXXX website. After a week or so, I called XXXX and was told that the check was probably in their system and should clear soon. I gave it a week or more knowing that the XXXX loan still showed now delinquent. I called XXXX again and was told to gibe it a little longer and it should be applied to payoff the balance. I dug deeper into the mailing process and discovered that payments generally go to XXXX CO. The XXXX. XXXX is XXXX XXXX CO. XXXX, so I had my Credit Union put a stop payment on the check and reissue to XXXX and was sent to the XXXX CO address. I felt confident that this would be the final solution to getting the proceeds to XXXX, however, today is XX/XX/2017 and the loan still shows way too far past due. We simply want to pay off this account. I am concerned about any credit bureau repercussions as a result. We planned way far enough in advance to get this loan paid off. This has been going on since XX/XX/2017 ... Can you please intervene and help get this issue resolved? 
The CFPB responded on XX/XX/2017 with this : XXXX received your payment of {$1900.00} dated XX/XX/2017. This payment cleared any delinquency on your account. We are able to confirm no negative delinquency information has been reported to the credit bureaus by XXXX. However, we are unable to honor your requested payoff amount of {$1900.00} from XX/XX/2017, since the delay in receipt of your intital XX/XX/2017 payment and the payment dated XX/XX/2017 were not due to any error on our part. Interest continues to accrue on a loan balance in repayment until a payment is received and processed. As per our telephone conversation on XX/XX/2017 we have waived the remaining late fees as a one-time courtesy. With your payment of {$14.00} dated XX/XX/2017 your account is now showing as paid in full. You should shortly receive a "" Paid in Full '' letter, indicating you no longer owe any money for these loans.

They kept telling me, do n't worry, we 'll find the payment, this happens all the time, .... When in reality, they were saying, we are glad to let the loan you took out from your Credit Union accrue interest as well as continue to charge interest on our loan. They were not interested in helping me solve my frustration, they simply turned out to be greedy.

I could argue that several of the reasoning options listed above would suffice as a grounds for complaint, ie., did not get proper help over the phone, problem with statement of dispute, investigation took too long, etc. ... .and, I could probably add a few more not listed. I am frustrated! 
My complaint is against TransUnion for not addressing my dispute with original creditor ( collection agency ) with proper ethics and advocacy on my part. I have disputed this balance several times now with TransUnion because the original creditor will not comply with requests for itemized and detailed invoices and line item charges which I have requested multiple times from collection agency who now has this account. My purpose in requesting these was to instigate an affidavit of unauthorized charges on this original account. I get nowhere with collection agency and in fact am told that they are only required to provide basic and satisfying information to validate the debt to the reporting credit bureau. I know it is my account, however, the question is accuracy of amount due because of these unauthorized charges. My complaint with original creditor is that these unauthorized charges are the result of retailer ( in this case XXXX revolving card ) not verifying my identity with proper ID at time of purchase therefore allowing unauthorized person ( s ) to charge to my account. Twice in XX/XX/XXXX, attempts were made with representative XXXX at collection agency ( XXXX XXXX ) but told each time that his agency has sent required docs to reporting agencies. I requested to haves them sent to me as well and was told that I should get them in 7-10 days. I had even sent, via mail, a request for documents and NOT EVEN a response back. Nothing! 
At this time, this is neither here nor there now as I have moved past trying to get the collection agency to provide my requests and now see that my time is wasted dealing with the collection agency as I was getting nowhere. Therefore, I directed my complaint to TransUnion in the hope that their investigation would prompt collection agency to provide accurate account information. 
TransUnion has a responsibility in proper investigating and in reporting to me the timely status of the investigation instead of the dry and customary "" meets FCRA requirements ''. I have disputed this twice now ( three if you count the initial phone call dispute ) with TransUnion and do n't even get the courtesy of a letter or email to notify me of status or findings. I am very frustrated and feel as though I have no rights in this matter and have gotten nowhere in following recommended protocol and steps for resolution. This has been an education for me and I have learned that the reporting bureaus do n't have to substantiate anything except known public record type of information to satisfy the proof of debt. The credit process has been made to be a black or white issue with reporting and follows a general set of guidelines and protocol therefore making it a laborious process to communicate situations and disputes that are not always black or white and do require more ethical investigation than just the standardized proof of debt validation. On top of this, it has easy to see the close relationship that the bureaus keep with the lenders and creditors that works against the borrower in many cases when a person such as myself has to fight for my right to obtain information and request dispute resolutions. 

For final disposition on this matter, I request that this be removed from my report with TransUnion as I see no other viable or satisfying solution and have exhausted all resources.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

Then, MCM began to call/send letters demanding money for an account we had with XXXX. I asked MCM for a detailed explanation as to what the charges are for and they provide me nothing. 

I just got off the phone with XXXX today ( representatives name was XXXX ). XXXX tells me that she can not provide details of what those charges are as they sold my full account to MCM and are not able to see the details any longer. 

I then hung up and called MCM, again. I explained the situation and the representative ( XXXX XXXX sp? ) explained to me that he could not see the details.

Please understand that I do n't have any issue in paying any amount that I may owe. As noted, when I ask for those details they ca n't or wo n't provide it to me.

2681,"I have disputed the issue with the reporting company but have not received a final response other than what shows on my credit tracking apps. 
I could argue that several of the reasoning options listed above would suffice as a grounds for complaint, ie., did not get proper help over the phone, problem with statement of dispute, investigation took too long, etc. ... .and, I could probably add a few more not listed. I am frustrated! 
My complaint is against TransUnion for not addressing my dispute with original creditor ( collection agency ) with proper ethics and advocacy on my part. I have disputed this balance several times now with TransUnion because the original creditor will not comply with requests for itemized and detailed invoices and line item charges which I have requested multiple times from collection agency who now has this account. My purpose in requesting these was to instigate an affidavit of unauthorized charges on this original account. I get nowhere with collection agency and in fact am told that they are only required to provide basic and satisfying information to validate the debt to the reporting credit bureau. I know it is my account, however, the question is accuracy of amount due because of these unauthorized charges. My complaint with original creditor is that these unauthorized charges are the result of retailer ( in this case XXXX XXXX ) not verifying my identity with proper ID at time of purchase therefore allowing unauthorized person ( s ) to charge to my account. Twice, attempts were made with representative XXXX XXXX at collection agency ( The Bureaus ) but told each time that his agency does not get those documents from the original creditor and therefore can not and is not required to supply them to me or to the reporting credit bureaus. I had even sent, via mail, a request for documents and NOT EVEN a response back. 
At this time, this is neither here nor there now as I have moved past trying to get the collection agency to provide my requests and now see that my time is wasted dealing with the collection agency as I was getting nowhere. Therefore, I directed my complaint to TransUnion in the hope that their investigation would prompt collection agency to provide accurate account information. 
TransUnion has a responsibility in proper investigating and in reporting to me the timely status of the investigation instead of the dry and customary "" meets FCRA requirements ''. I have disputed this twice now ( three if you count the initial phone call dispute ) with TransUnion and do n't even get the courtesy of a letter or email to notify me of status or findings. I am very frustrated and feel as though I have no rights in this matter and have gotten nowhere in following recommended protocol and steps for resolution. This has been an education for me and I have learned that the reporting bureaus do n't have to substantiate anything except known public record type of information to satisfy the proof of debt. The credit process has been made to be a black or white issue with reporting and follows a general set of guidelines and protocol therefore making it a laborious process to communicate situations and disputes that are not always black or white and do require more ethical investigation than just the standardized proof of debt validation. On top of this, it has easy to see the close relationship that the bureaus keep with the lenders and creditors that works against the borrower in many cases when a person such as myself has to fight for my right to obtain information and request dispute resolutions. 
For final disposition on this matter, I request that this be removed from my report with TransUnion as I see no other viable or satisfying solution and have exhausted all resources.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

I really did n't want theirs, wanted to match mine and of course get the mold out as soon as possible. Every time I stayed, I came home sick. 
They offered to do other things that I agreed to, but only the first portion of the work was done, which I have already paid {$630.00} for. 
Then after countless emails, text, I was told that the carpet they bought was ruined by the person they had bind it. There were no definite plans was in place to fix my camper. I then decided to discontinue the service and go to another direction. 
Then, his wife, XXXX, starting issuing threat after threat. I tried very hard to resolve this but could n't get anywhere with her. She even accused me of insurance fraud, which I 'm sure my estimator would testify that he ask me about my couch and I told him not to worry about it, I just want my camper livable. 
She then gave me 10 days to pay a falsified invoice {$1200.00} or she would turn it over to collections. I was not able to go there within that 10 days ( it is 2 hours away from my home ) so I ask the RV park to check on some of the charges and I have the emails included that the XXXX outside items he could see ( battery or brake line ) were NOT installed. 
I paid {$23.00} to overnight a check for {$91.00} with a breakdown of what I thought was fair ( see included ). I was sent additional harassing messages by XXXX, even after I ask her to send me what she was talking about so we could work through it but I was told it was going to collections. 
I then receive the letter from Professional Collection Co. I called and spoke to XXXX there and offered all the documentation to prove these charges were falsified but she would not take any steps to try to resolve the situation. 
I went this week on Wednesday XX/XX/2017 and found the same. I took at picture of the battery box, water in it, and no battery for ages. My keys have not been returned, so XXXX XXXX XXXX still have complete access to every area of my camper, even storage.

2778,"In XXXX, I attended XXXX ( XXXX ) in XXXX, PA and took out student loans worth approximately {$50000.00}. Upon graduation in XXXX, working as a cook for {$8.00} per hour, Navient insisted I begin to pay back my loans at a rate of {$900.00} per month. As a single mom I could not afford to pay that amount. Every option Navient presented me with for repayment was absurd. One option for interest only loans dropped payments to {$850.00} which I still could not afford. I applied for loan consolidation with Navient, which would have lowered my loan repayment amount. However, my request was denied as a result of my credit. I was baffled because the same company which issued the loans based on my credit now denied me the ability to repay them at a lower rate because of my credit ; which had not declined since the initial loan. Navient stated I did not have a sufficient credit history. I tried to add my husband as a cosigner on the consolidation but was told they did not allow cosigners. Discouraged I talked to a lawyer about bankruptcy but was told it would not apply to student loans. I was left with no other choice except to defer the loans. I decided to go back to school in hope of one day making more money to pay back the loans. In the meantime the loans capitalized and my loan balance grew. It seemed I would never be able to dig myself out of the debt. In XXXX XXXX, because of a gap in school ( I had finished my XXXX and had not began XXXX. ) ; I had to begin repaying the loans. I had worked hard over those few years to build my credit so consolidation would be an option only to find out they no longer consolidated private loans. When Navient said I had to begin repaying they gave me 2 options : principle plus interests payments and interest only payments. After continually explaining I could not afford the {$1400.00} payments I was told there were n't any other options. Miraculously after much determination and pleading I was transferred to a representative with the Rate Reduction Plan. With a prescreening interview I was eligible for the program and payments were {$420.00} per month with an interest rate of 1 %, only to be bumped out of the program a few short months later. Navient did not explain to me with an "" in school '' status, I would be moved out of the program. Once removed from the plan, Navient continued to collect payment at a much high interest rate of 13.25 % ; I was not informed of the change. When I requested a refund, it was denied. I was told I would not be able to rejoin the program until XXXX XXXX which was one year from the initial sign up date and my loans capitalized even more. Once I graduated with a M.A. my payment went up almost $ XXXX monthly. With the program I will still eventually end up back at a {$1400.00} payment after the rate increase each year. I now owe a lot of money in federal loans as well because I had to avoid defaulting on the Navient loans by returning back to school. I am able to pay smaller amounts on the federal loans. I currently pay almost {$600.00} in loans to Navient which is extremely hard on our family. As a military spouse it is difficult to find employment because we move so often but I must continue to pay. In XXXX, I owed {$120000.00} culinary school, I currently owe {$110000.00} not including XXXX ( fed ) for my XXXX and XXXX I must reapply every year and based on my debt to income ratio I have to pay a much higher rate in the future ; there is an automatic % 1 increase regardless of debt to income ratio. Each year calling back for renewal brings a lot stress as Navient representative are rude and exert their authority. I have been threatened to be dropped from the plan for ridiculous reasons.

2779,"The complaint is with Navient. 
Navient refuses to provide the outstanding balance on loans when interest is capitalized or payments are received. Their online service only provides the original loand amount and the current balance. However, when viewing transaction history, the total balance is not shown, only capitalized, charges, and payments. Upon calling to ask for balance amounts before and after payments, all supervisors refused to provide me with this information. I was instructed to take the original loan amount and manually go through the transactions line by line ( from origination date in 2007 to present ). 
The practice of refusing to show a running balance due per transaction hurts consumers, and can esily lead to unscrupulous or abusive practices, as the consumer is essentially 'flying blind ' on the total due per each transaction. 
Upon speaking with Navient, they were unwilling to provide a transaction history with all transactions listed and how the balance has increased or decreased.

I let them know that I was completely unaware of this and never charge a single credit card on my merchant account ( I opened this account to allow my customers to make ACH payments to me - they are usually less than $ XXXX/month ). XXXX XXXX XXXX never even notified me that my bank account was changed and I did not authorize a change of my bank account at any time. 

Obviously, the bank account was not opened in my name, as they must be opened in person with photo ID according to the Patriot Act. XXXX XXXX XXXX will not release to me the name of the person whose credit card initiated the charge back and they wo n't give me the name of the bank and account # where the funds were deposited, so I have no way of knowing exactly how this even happened. I can report that I received an ACH deposit the Monday after this alleged credit card charge ( Father 's Day ), so this must have been a very quick change. 

Since I did not initiate the change of this bank account information and did not make this charge, I should not be held accountable for it. I notified XXXX XXXX of this and they acknowledge it was probably fraud, yet they will do absolutely nothing on their end to investigate this fraud. They are only willing to proceed with collections against me, even though I had nothing no ability to control their security practices, which are obviously flawed. 

On my end, I did file a police report of this fraud and a fraud report with the Federal Trade Commission. I continued to receive calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX demanding payment along with threats that they were going to send me to collections. I kept denying I made this charge, yet they still proceeded with collections.

Unfortunately during my time at XXXX College and XXXX University I found myself, like most blue collar students, having to borrow money to make it through. I was told that not alot of places will lend to a student who does not have a high credit score, this made things more tense, until I was told that Sallie Mae could help. 

This was not really a blessing but a curse in disguise. At this time I was working a part time job as a XXXX not making anything and still had to work there even after my graduation in XXXX 2015 because the economy is bad and it became harder to get XXXX even after getting a degree. So a few months before my loans were due XXXX found myslef worrying about how can I be more proactive about getting on top of things and making my life easier. Well the answer I was looking for was never found. 

I called Sallie Mae about two months before and spoke with a representative about what i could do because it seemed like every loan I used from them was separate and had its own minimum payment and interest rate. I thought to myself this could not be right because that would mean i would have extremely high minimum payments and I would never pay this off living on a XXXX salary. Unfortunately my doubts were actually reality! The representatives I spoke with the first time told me that I was correct and that there was nothing they really could do at the time to consolidate them. 

At this time i was mad as all get out because how is that we go to college to become better yet we get stuck with tremendous amount of debt and hold us back from continuing our pursuit in academia. After speaking with a few representatives I get ahold of a different person they tell me that they can lower my payments from about XXXX to about XXXX. I am at this point tired of trying. They would never consolidate nor offer me the ability to add a cosigner. 

After this occured I gave up. I tried finding different loan companies that would consolidate but because I had so much debt no one would touch it because the loans ruined my credit score. Now at this time I am stuck and do not know how to fix my situation. 

So I call them back and ask again and i still do not get any help. Now remember, I started this way before they were due and now it is past due. Now it is almost two months past and they threaten me with collections. My credit score has dropped tremendously and now they tell me we can give you 2 % interest rate and a payment of XXXX per month. Um, excuse me but why did you not help me before when you knew i could not afford the original payments and now I have a XXXX credit score and stuck with a financial burden that already adds stress to my already stressful life seeing how my job is not particularly liked at this time.

2860,"Apparently the settlement resulting from their XX/XX/XXXX A lawsuit was n't enough for XXXX XXXX ( formerly known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Although the school was forced to pay out approximately {>= $1,000,000} in settlement for complaints leading all the way back to XX/XX/XXXX, it apparently did n't have any impact on XXXX. More recent lawsuits have been filed against XXXX XXXX as well as against lender Sallie Mae by former students who claim that hidden fees suddenly appeared on their loans after their terms changed without their agreement. One such former student stated he found that his already ridiculous loan totally XX/XX/XXXX had ballooned to over {$220000.00} when it defaulted and he became aware of the hidden terms and their changes in addition to unreasonable debt collection fees by collectors. 

Students were led to believe that they were pretty well guaranteed jobs upon graduation and students could expect to earn between $ XXXX-XXXX per year. Considering the median salary for waged photographers is more like {$25000.00} per year and that XXXX has a XXXX dropout rate, this was proven to be highly unlikely a result for graduates. XXXX also requires that students begin paying back their loans for tuition within 6 months of walking in the door. This means students going to school full time have to come up with loan payments on tuition of {$25000.00} per year while still attending and is contrary to the industry standard. Most schools defer loan payments until students have graduated and are out of the program for 6 months. While some individuals state this is in the fine print somewhere, for low-income students, many of which are the first in their family to attend university, the fine print was missed if it did exist. 

Investigators discovered that contrary to what XXXX was stating about their job placement and salary expectations, not one graduate from the program was even earning {$50000.00} per year, let alone anything beyond the lower amount. XXXX jobs paying those substantial figures involve additional skills like journalism or communications, business savvy, and connections to get. 

With XXXX XXXX signing up hundreds of XXXX students per year in a job market that does n't require that many placements, how on earth did they expect all these students to find jobs. Many graduating students found that the XXXX jobs they could get were the generic type at XXXX or XXXX XXXX centers, earned not much beyond minimum wage, and did n't require a degree in XXXX. Flooding the field with hundreds of graduates per year was unlikely to improve those job prospects any ... if the students managed to graduate that is.

2873,"After making timely monthly minimum payments to Great Lakes for over 2 years, I made an extra payment in the month of XXXX 2016 of {$100.00} toward a specific loan in my loan package. I received a confirmation message to my Message Center on XXXX.org acknowledging that the payment would be applied to the specific loan as requested. Shortly thereafter the payment went through - except the {$100.00} was applied across all loans in my loan package, with a whopping {$2.00} allotted to the specified loan. 

When I called about a week later to resolve this issue - an issue brought to my attention only because I thought to check the Payment History page of my Great Lakes account - a Great Lakes representative told me he would submit a ticket to have the payment reverted and applied to the correct loan, but that it would take 5-7 business days to be resolved. 

When I called 8 business days later, having received no update from Great Lakes, a different representative told me there had been no such ticket made, and then began to suggest clearly invalid reasons for why there was actually no problem from their perspective. All this despite the fact that Great Lakes had already verified in writing that my payment was supposed to go to the specified loan. I asked to be connected to another representative, who told me that the payment would now be reversed and re-allocated when my next automatic monthly payment was processed on XXXX XXXX. 

I asked this representative for some sort of confirmation that this would indeed take place, owing to my steadily declining trust in Great Lakes after the last couple of phone calls. He assured me he would send me a "" custom e-mail '' to confirm this new supposed fix scheduled for XXXX XXXX, but that it would take "" 1-2 business days. '' At this point I was feeling a strong sense of deja vu. 

It does n't take 2 days to send an e-mail. But 2 business days later, not only have I not received said e-mail, but this last representative has also failed to answer any of my phone calls or return my voicemails. 

At this point, my confidence in this issue actually being resolved in XXXX is virtually nonexistent. And even in the unlikely event that my issue is resolved, Great Lakes ' behavior in this matter is, to my mind, tantamount to fraud. At every step of the way I 've been misinformed, misdirected, or otherwise placated, without any sort of resolution to my issue, the cause of which lies squarely with Great Lakes. It 's become painfully obvious that Great Lakes representatives are trained not to try to fix problems, but to make up bogus reasons - "" the catch '' - for why debtors ' payments are n't being applied the way they should be. Worst of all is the fact that I now feel actively discouraged from paying my loans. How can I trust that if I make another payment toward my loans, Great Lakes wo n't simply take it and apply it elsewhere, in other words, lie to me again? 

I 'm reaching out to CFPB in the desperate hope that Great Lakes can be held to some form of accountability.

After calling XXXX XXXX due to seeing the account had been transferred and the stuff still had not been picked up, they told me they could no longer do anything about the account and that I would need to talk to the collection company. XXXX XXXX purposely over charged me and ruined my credit when they decided not to pick up their product after multiple phone calls. 

I called collection company and they told me I had a {$330.00} balance and I would need to bring the equipment to the crystal warehouse and it would adjust the balance down to {$110.00}. I told them that crystal water was supposed to have picked up the products, but never did. The rep told me no one would be coming to pick the stuff up and that I would need to bring the equipment and bottles in or be charged for them. I drove over 45 minutes to drop off the stuff at XXXX 's location. The rep asked me why I was dissatisfied with the product and I explained everything that happened. He informed me that the XXXX XXXX drivers are understaffed in the area and that is why they never came to pick up the equipment and water. I am being penalized by way of being over charged and my credit ruined for a problem within the XXXX XXXX company. It is my belief that XXXX XXXX has also misrepresented the status of account to CBA.

I 've been trying for years to get the bureaus to remove it, but because its the IRS, they do n't want to do it. I finally called the IRS Advocacy group again and they confirmed that they have no record of the debt because it was removed, since I proved it was n't my debt. They recommended that I get the FTC involved to force the IRS to remove the tax lien history from my credit profile. Currently, there are several tax liens that show "" paid/satisfied, '' but that implies that I owed the debt at one time and paid it off, neither of which is true. Because the debt was never mine, any and all record of the tax liens should be stricken from my credit profile. As result of having those liens reported, although showing "" satisfied, '' my credit scores are being severely affected and I 'm having to pay much higher interest rates and getting denied from necessary credit.

4. DCS will not stop certifying your debt to the IRS. We are required to certify debt. 



5. The Division of Child Support has not received your tax refund from the IRS.

3006,"Summary of Claim Higher Education Services Corporation ( HESC ) : 1. failure to produce original loan agreements detailing terms of loans ; 2. verbally informed me that interest rate on 3 Parent PLUS loans was 3.13 % but failed produce written confirmation 3. demonstrated neglect in processing Administrative Review 4. continue to destroy my FICO score - a contributing factor to current homelessness 5. create continued stress and chaos in my life, adversely affecting my well-being in every aspect of my life. 

Terms of the XXXX Parent PLUS loans : total amt. borrowed {$26000.00} ; 120 payments ; stated interest rate ( s ) per phone conversation with XXXX XXXX per phone conversation in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX is 3.13 %. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I took out the first of XXXX Parent PLUS loans. After the third loan was funded and coupon books issued, I wrote one monthly checkfor all XXXX loans and included the three monthly payment coupons with the check. This procedure worked when paying for XXXX loans. With the third loan payment, XXXX XXXX began applying the payment to XXXX or XXXX loan ( s ) in spite of the three payment coupons. Their explanation : they had no way of knowing which loan I was paying and claimed the right to apply payments however they saw fit. To avoid late fees and the threatened misinformation to the credit bureaus, thereby adversely affecting my XXXX FICO score, I sought a better solution. Their recommendation : consolidation of my XXXX Parent PLUS loans. This was predatory and probably fraudulent for the following reasons : a lender/servicer fabricated need for loan consolidation ; undisclosed terms and conditions of loans e.g. doubling the # of payments from XXXX to XXXX ; incorrect beginning balance for the consolidated loan ; ambiguity as to interest rates on the Parent PLUS loans thereby allowing XXXX XXXX to covertly convert an interest rate of 3.13 % to 8.25 %. 

I would not have knowingly agreed to a loan that increased the interest rate from 3.13 % or even 6.54 % ( another amount referenced in a communication with XXXX XXXX ) to 8.25 %, nor would I have knowingly agreed to doubling the number of payments. Such behavior would have been inconsistent with my financial and business skills. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I paid XXXX XXXX {$32000.00}, without missing a single scheduled payment. As you can see, I repaid all the money borrowed plus {$6200.00} in interest. XX/XX/XXXX, I refused to give XXXX XXXX more money. XX/XX/XXXX, on the advise of a bankruptcy attorney, I made one payment to XXXX XXXX and agreed to a deferment so that I could file for bankruptcy on other debt. I believe that was bad advise but did so under duress. ( My financial crisis came as a result of having lost $ XXXX on a real estate sale when the real estate market collapsed. This amount represents my interest in the transaction, not its total value. ) The student loan defaulted to the loan guarantor, HESC, in XXXX XXXX. I requested an Administrative Review. When I called to check on the status of the Review, I was informed that student loans can not be discharged in bankruptcy therefore I still owe the money. Apparently, whoever looked at my Request for Administrative Review failed to even attempt to understand my Request by reading the XXXX pages of documentation I submitted. When I asked to speak to the person who had Reviewed my case, I was told that that would not be possible.

While it is factual that they did not receive payment, and I do not dispute that - they failed to update my billing instructions per my communication. I made this communication to all of my other credit cards and it was updated without issue. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I moved from XXXX to the United States. When I came back, a charge on my FIA card came back as 'suspicious ' and required me to call the fraud department to verify my address, contact information and other information. When I called, I instructed them to update my address in the system so my bill would be sent to that address. They failed to turn off electronic billing as part of that request, update my phone number, or billing address. I know that they failed to update this information because when I called to dispute the credit information, the BOA employee told me that their system showed that my mail was being returned. 

On XXXX XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX, a credit monitoring company, that negative information was posted to my report. That day, I located what account was being reported as late and immediately called BOA/FIA and made a payment to clear the entire balance to {$0.00}. At that point I explained the issue to the staff and they proceeded to argue that I was responsible ; they failed to notify me of my rights to file a dispute, so I escalated to a supervisor. After ~30 seconds the supervisor came on the phone and his tone was much nicer. He said that he would file a dispute and "" word it in a way that worked best for me, that hes working for me and knows what to put in the report so it comes out on my side ''. He did not collect other data, ask about my dispute or why I am disputing, or any of the facts that would typically be required to make a dispute. Essentially the dispute process was a joke ; but he left me feeling like it would be resolved. 

1 week later, I received a note from FIA card services that they "" investigated '' my dispute ( still unaware of what he put I was disputing ) and that they found the mark to be credible. This note looked auto-generated, without any care put into how the investigating addressed what I thought the issue was. 

I then filed a complaint with the XXXX. In response to this complaint, BOA reached out to me over the phone and initially told me that they had not, in fact, reported any negative information. After providing my social security number though, they were able to locate the account. The representative proceeded to say I was liable, and got me so upset by his lack of responding to my specific issues ( I updated my address when their fraud department called - why had BOA not done it in their system?, he claimed I was not receiving mail from BOA, despite the other associate saying their systems showed my mail was being returned ). I asked on the telephone to escalate to their supervisor and the associate did not transfer and said he needed to investigate more. The associate was a bully - I do n't know how else to explain it, and had cast his judgement early in the call. Mind you this was all being done before any investigation on my specific card was done by this associate. 

Facts : I asked for my address and contact information to be updated, and BOA failed to do so on a fraud prevention call. Had they done this I would have received notice about my bill. 

I will be buying a house in several months, and these negative remarks will have a negative consequence on my ability to secure a mortgage if BOA does not make this change.

He implored people to save every piece of writing from collection companies and compare for changes. He and the person from the state were right. I was happy n content that I had an agreement and was making payments as planned. But, luckily, I looked at the statement, and without notification or explanation, they added {$16000.00} +/-. 
I have all documentation from the Dept. of Education to show the correct amount due, and from the collection agency, that showed the correct amount then the increased amount, too. All on letterhead from the company. 
I was so proud to have been successfully paying on a target debt amount and watching it go down. Now, such devious behavior that was mentioned on XXXX XXXX show and by the state dept. of consumer affairs has happened to me. I 'm proud to have used my school loans to better my career and to have begun faithfully paying it back. But, such changing of numbers has hurt my encouragement.

Please allow me to explain : I went through a divorce about XXXX years ago, at which time, I gave the title to our home to now my ex-wife. This was to keep the children in their home and minimize the disruption as much as possible. However, I was the sole person on the bank mortgage with XXXX Bank. Within the divorce decree I increase the necessary maintenance to my ex wife in order for her to be able to pay the mortgage and keep the house. Although I continued to send the necessary funds to her each month to cover that mortgage, she pocketed the money and did not pay. I asked my attorney if I could withhold those funds each month from her and pay the mortgage myself, at which time i was advised that it would be illegal to do so. So this went on for several months despite both my attorney and myself saying we would have to take this to court. After about XXXX months of non payment, we did take this to court in XXXX of 2012. She was found to be in contempt of court and ordered to bring the mortgage current within XXXX months and make the expected payments in the future. She ignored this court order and never paid a dime for the mortgage, despite my continuing to pay her the money to do so. This went on for a period of XXXX months until she put the house up for short sale. In the meantime my credit score continued to plument though no fault of my own. 
I brought this to all three credit reporting agencies including the supporting documentation from both the divorce decree and the contempt of court charge with reason listed from the courts.

During a recent research into my credit files, it had been revealed that the credit bureaus reported a XXXX payment history, excellent rating on number of accounts, good rating on age of accounts, just to name a few categories. 
Scores are based on the information contained in your credit report, confirming that the credit information on your report is accurate will ensure that the score is correct regardless of the model used.

This is inaccurate data and should be removed. I am disputing you reporting adverse key factors. I find your actions not to remove these adverse key factors totally absurd and totally inaccurate. 
Credit Bureaus appear to categorize accounts under specific Key Factors, derived from information reported by the credit bureaus. Customer being unable to determine what accounts are categorized under a particular key factor, has no chose but to dispute the reported key factor. For example which accounts are delinquent? If you find no delinquent accounts, then this key factor should not be reported to creditors nor should it be reflected on ones ' credit file. Research has revealed that the credit bureaus did not provide any data to support these adverse key factors or list accounts that have been labeled as an adverse key factor. 
Attached are letters and disclosures which state the identical adverse key factors that had been reported back in 2012. No changes in verbage. Looks like these adverse key factors may have been copied and pasted.

Since graduating XX/XX/XXXX they have sold off some of my loans to XXXX and kept the majority that had very high interest rates. They allowed me to put them in a forbearance for a certain amount of time but once that time was up I was not able to defer them any longer. I had to jump through hoops to get them to put them into a forbearance while I was away for XXXX and would n't have access to electronic devices to be able to pay my bill.

3071,"Hello. I have a formal complaint to lodge against Navient and am trying to go through the proper channels to do it. 
Here is what occurred : I wanted to send in a bulk payment of {$2000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX since some unexpected money had come in ( my aunt had passed away, and a small bank account was located with a couple thousand dollars ). 
I called Navient BEFORE I sent in the XXXX to get their assurance that the money would be applied toward my monthly payments ( which were {$110.00} at that time ) and not toward the principal. We discussed the time that payments would resume in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX. 
I received their guarantee that this money would be applied to these monthly payments which would have meant that another payment at that XXXX rate would not be due for a year and four months ( so around XX/XX/XXXX ). 
I sent in the payment of {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was asked to fill out the income-based paperwork in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, and I submitted it. I made less that year than the previous year. 
I received notification from Navient that I would need to start making payments of {$55.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called Navient in XXXX and an hour and a half into the inquiry, the supervisor agreed with me that no payment was due until XX/XX/XXXX, in fact if the payments were calculated starting in XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, the payment already sent in should be applied even past XX/XX/XXXX. The supervisor who confirmed that what I was saying was accurate stated that he would send a confirmation of the adjustment within ten days. 
The adjustment confirmation did not arrive. 
I called back and was given some story about the previous year 's payment schedule having ended after 10 months instead of the full year ( no explanation given concerning why that would have been true, especially since I always turn everything in on time and properly completed & no payment schedule before this one had been ended early ) and that my payments had reverted back to the originally threatened $ 300+ that would 've been the amount due if I had not applied for income-based consideration. 
Since they cited this 300+ amount as what was taken out as payment from the {$2000.00}, they had come up with monthly payments of {$55.00} being due starting in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have not had time to say anything about this due to my mother 's sudden illness and consequent move from the house where she 'd lived for 28 years. That plus my job have kept me over-occupied until now. 
The bottom line here is that Navient lied to me at all points along the way and stole portions of my money that they were not entitled to. 
I 've been making the XXXX payments since XX/XX/XXXX since I have no recourse. 
I contacted the Navient advocacy group, and it turns out that the income-based program that I was in when I called them in XX/XX/XXXX has particular perameters that would have precluded the payments being applied past a year. They readily agreed that I was given misinformation but that they did not have the power to go back and adjust anything ; all they were willing to do was to pass on the complaint. 
It is my contention that Navient still is responsible for what I was told. They dispensed the misinformation upon which I based my decision about where best to distribute the money. I was trying to be responsible and have the payments covered almost up to when I retire in XX/XX/XXXX. I would have put the money toward paying off my credit card or toward the principal on my mortgage otherwise. They can not give people misinformation that people act on in good faith without being accountable. They ca n't tell people the wrong thing that results in loss of money on the consumer end and then just say sorry, sorry.

I understand that these are private loans and they can do whatever they want to my interest rate ( though I swear I signed up originally for a fixed rate loan, but ca n't find my paperwork ), but I signed up for auto payment in order to receive a .25 percent rate reduction. Within one or two months, the rate went up to void that reduction. This was frustrating, but what can I do. They hold all the cards and talk in circles when you try to get information. 

Now, I have extra funds that I would like to apply to the principal of my loan, to try and reduce it so I can eventually pay off the loan, and I am told that I ca n't do that. Instead, it must first satisfy any unpaid interest. If I am satisfying my monthly payments, which they pull automatically from my bank account, how can I not apply extra in a specific way? From what I have read online and from conversations that I have had with other student loan holders, other people are able to do this with their Navient loans, but they say mine does not qualify. I am paying 10 % interest on a {$30000.00} loan ( and that is just XXXX of XXXX ), so I need to be able to pay principal only to get this paid off. I was told the only way to do that is to pay the same day as your due date, but that means I ca n't pay extra on my principal for a month, meaning they make extra money on the interest for the entire month. This is unfair and seems like taking advantage of me as a borrower. The interest accrues daily, so I can pay a payment and have some of it allocated to interest and it still makes my principal a bit smaller, but if I was allowed to pay the entire {$500.00} that I want to on interest, it puts me in a better position overall to pay less interest, reduce my loan amount and get out of debt faster. I have been out of school for almost 7 years, and have been unable to make much progress towards this loan, despite having paid for a majority of that time. This loan has never been delinquent, anytime I was unable to satisfy the payment I called and they charged me to put it into forbearance. It seems like this student loan nightmare will never end. I have loans with other companies, and none have treated me like Navient has. 

I realize that Navient is in the business of making money off student loans. This seems unreasonable and unfair to not allow a customer to pay above their monthly payment and pay on principal only. They have set this up so that you are not able to pay them less in interest and make it extremely difficult to get your loan paid off without coming up with a lump sum. 

From what I read online, it would be easier and possibly put me in a better position to stop paying on the loan and try to negotiate a lump sum payment with one of their debt collectors. I made an agreement to pay this amount when Navient loaned me the money, and I am trying to stand by that, but they seem to want to make it impossible to get this loan paid off.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

I responded immediately via email that the loan was not subsidized and a deferment was not in my best interest because not only would the interest accrue but I would lose the rate reductions in place on my automatic payments and the loan interest rate itself would rise because they charged more during deferment periods than payment periods.

3213,"XX/XX/2015, I was directed by Fed Loan Servicing ( "" Fed Loan '' ) to recertify my income for my income-based repayment plan. Since my wife and I file taxes jointly, I needed to include her income, but she is a XXXX and does not receive regular pay. My salary is the vast majority of our income, her pay comprises around XXXX % of our income. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a verification with a summary of gross receipts evidencing my wife 's income and my pay stubs. Weeks later, I received a letter notifying me my application was denied due to insufficient documentation. I called Fed Loan and found it the insufficiency dealt specifically with my wife 's income. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted another verification, this time with my wife 's business 's bank statements for the previous 4 months detailing her average income. Again, weeks later, I received a letter notifying me my application was denied due to insufficient documentation. I called Fed Loan and found it the insufficiency dealt specifically with my wife 's income. I was told to submit a letter signed by my wife stating how much money she earns on average and how often. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a third verification with a letter signed by my wife detailing her gross business income, gross expenses, and average net take home pay as well as my pay stubs. I also decided to change repayment plans from income based repayment to the REPAYE plan. Finally, weeks later, I received notice my application had been received and was being reviewed. 
After a few more weeks, I called Fed Loan for a status. I was told that it would take about 2 months to review the documentation I submitted to come up with a new payment amount. At this time, because my previous attempts to recertify my income were rejected, I was moved to a standard repayment plan automatically which almost doubled my payment due. I made the payment in XX/XX/XXXX hoping the situation would resolve soon. In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a forbearance to continue to pay my IBR payment amount. My forbearance request was denied and a direct debit for the full amount, in addition to the reduced payment I had set up was made, i.e. I paid 3 times my normal amount due to the direct debit. When I called Fed Loan, I was informed they rarely gave out refunds for extra payments, but that the rep would put in a request for this situation. I never heard about it again. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted another forbearance request and continued waiting for an update. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called for a status and was told I needed to name an interim repayment amount while Fed Loan switched me from IBR to REPAYE. I did this and paid the amount. 
In XX/XX/XXXX the new payment amount still had not taken effect. I called Fed Loan again and was told I was close to being complete and that a new amount should show up around my payment date. As I was in forbearance, I made no payment. 
Then, I received a letter postmarked XXXX XXXX informing me that I owed Fed Loan a payment on XXXX XXXX. My outstanding balance again was somehow combined with the next two months to make an outstanding balance over {$1000.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from Fed Loan detailing that my request for REPAYE was denied due to, surprise, documentation for my wife 's income. I was told her letter submitted in XX/XX/XXXX contained too much (? ) information and that they only wanted a simple statement of income. They told me to fax in a new application and documentation and wait. I did, and have heard nothing. 
It took Fed Loan five months to review the sufficiency of the documentation I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX.

The woman on the phone said that she was legally allowed to call my family no more that once a day. I asked her to verify her company name, address, telephone number and professional license number. She responded with "" Absolutely not. '' I said I needed debt verification and I wanted to know who they purchased this debt from. She proceeded to speak over me and continued to say "" I will put you in refusal to pay '' and then hung up. 

I called back immediately. As soon as she answered the phone, the woman said something along the lines of "" You need to stop calling us. '' I said that I was simply seeking debt verification and she said that if I continued to call she would press charges against me. 

I called the XXXX who said that this company was not on their radar until XX/XX/XXXX, which is when they first started calling my family. They are threatening, they have had people pretend to be law officers leave messages, they did not tell me how to dispute the debt or seek verification of the debt. They would not give me the name of the original creditor. They would not verify that they are licensed in their states. Ultimately I want them to stop contacting my family members but I also want to file a complaint so their tactics are officially on record.

We called XXXX and said since this was an emergency, they should cover the cost of the hospitalist treatment. XXXX agreed. They sent us a check ( # XXXX ) made out to me in the amount of {$210.00} and told us to sign the check over to XXXX. We did so. 

Here 's where things got interesting. XXXX XXXX, unbeknownst to us, made a mistake and separately sent another {$210.00} check to XXXX. This caused a double payment. Rather than following up with XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent us a letter ( XXXX Inquiry Number : XXXX ) saying we owed them the {$210.00} back. They also started sending collections letters from XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The problem is that we had already signed the original check over to XXXX. 

I tried to resolve this situation by calling XXXX and asking them to refund XXXX XXXX. I talked to XXXX in the billing department at XXXX ( phone number XXXX ). XXXX said that they had indeed received a double payment and would refund XXXX XXXX one of the checks. 

XXXX mailed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the refund around XX/XX/XXXX. However, after 30 days, XXXX XXXX was still sending collections letters. I called XXXX XXXX and talked to XXXX XXXX ( sp? ) who said she would look into this for me. 

XXXX called XXXX and asked her to stop payment on the original check and mail a second check. XXXX did so. She sent out a second check to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX. 

Again, XXXX XXXX apparently was not showing that they received this second check 30 days later. In addition, XXXX XXXX officially sent us to the "" real '' collections company, Receivable Management Services Corporation.

Furthermore, Equifax Information Services say that they have deleted and corrected addresses, telephones, and accounts, of which I have been notified by them by mail, and then they have change back all these invalid entries as the correct one, this has been happening persistently, this is a clear act of mockery. Equifax inefficiency against my case goes as far to state that the police report which I filed in the police station XX/XX/2015 to a police officer that I am a victim of identity theft and the Affidavit given to me by the FTC, plus all the evidences that I have provided are just not enough, which is just a bad joke. How is possible that other CRAs XXXX and others have conducted their investigations, from which I claimed the same day as to Equifax, XX/XX/XXXX, by fax and certified mail, complying with the FCRA 605B which clearly state that that ""...a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later THAN FOUR (4) BUSINESS DAYS after the date of receipt by such agency..."", all proving me right and giving me favorable results like correcting errors and deleting negative information which is the result of the identity theft within the timeframe stated by the law.

3379,"This complaint is directed against the apartment community XXXX, located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX, and operated by XXXX. 

I recently terminated my lease due to an out-of-state job offer. I gave the required 60 days ' notice in person XX/XX/2016, but the leasing agent ( intentionally I believe ) failed to inform me that written notice was needed. When I attempted to end the lease, and pay the buyout fee of two months ' rent ( {$3100.00} ) after 60 days on XX/XX/2016, they falsely claimed I had never given them notice. While it 's clear to me that this is nothing more than an attempt on their part to collect more rent than they were owed, I have no legal recourse in this specific aspect of my complaint due to the lack of written notice. 

However, they have attempted to bill me for a flat 60 days of rent on top of the termination fee ( 2 months ' base rent ), despite the fact that the apartment was rented during this "" penalty period '' of 4 months ; in effect collecting rent from both me and the new tenant, who I believe took possession of the apartment around XX/XX/2016 ( the time it was de-listed from their website ). In their most recent communication to me, they claimed that the apartment was "" held '' until XX/XX/2016, but I find this hard to believe as their standard policy is to only hold apartments currently available ( as it was at the time ) for 7 days. 

Regardless of the date it was rented, by their own admission, they are charging double rent between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2016. Virginia state law, which limits landlords to recovering only actual damages, forbids this. Additionally, it requires that the security deposit is returned upon vacating the premises, which they have also failed to do. 

Section XXXX of the lease contract [ attached as XXXX XXXX Lease XXXX ] clearly states that, in the event of an early termination of the lease, a reletting charge of {$1500.00} per month is due up until a new tenant takes possession of the apartment, and acknowledges the existence of the aforementioned law : "" By law, we are limited to the recovery of actual damages. "". 

As part of my final attempt to remedy this situation, my attorney mailed a settlement offer of {$3100.00} on XX/XX/2016 ( equivalent to two months ' rent ) [ attached as WheelhouseSettlementOffer.pdf ], to which they did not respond. They instead sent me directly to collections for {$5000.00} - four months ' rent, with an additional "" cleaning fee '' that they did not provide receipts for or any proof of despite repeated requests.

However, the management and corporate office of the apartment complex continue to argue that I am liable because I am not off the lease until the new tenant physically move in. 

Nonsense! My lease expired, so do not try to make me pay for something that has nothing to do with me. Yet, the corporate office continues to sent harassment letters for 1.5 year-after I have ask them to stop in writing.

I attempted to advise them not to deliver any product. They say I was unsuccessful in my attempts and therefore I owe them the fee. I have disputed this through my credit card. 

They appear to premise my desire for their product on an automatic renewal process. While viewing the "" automatic renewal '' as a scam unto itself, I also contend that they intentionally make difficult any efforts by consumer to "" decline '' their product.

Attempted Communication : I responded to each email that XXXX sent to me on this topic in XXXX and XXXX of 2015. However, responding using the method of their choice ( email ) and to the address they use to contact me - resulted only in an email response to me indicating it was an "" unmonitored '' email box. XXXX got my email but chose not to review the content. They chose to put some hurdles for customers to overcome to communicate and stop XXXX 's unsolicited contact. 
o XXXX 's automated response said, among other things, that I could find out more about my options by creating a customer account and identity with them. This was not an attractive option for a company from which I was trying to disengage. 
At this same time, I called the customer support telephone number listed on their website. After working my way through their automated phone menu ( no human being to speak with ), their system thanked me and hung up. I tried this a XXXX time with the same results. 
Finally, I sent XXXX a short note saying I did n't want their product. XXXX noted in their justification for successful deliver to me that they did not get a "" fail to deliver '' notification. Similarly, with my note - I did not get a fail to deliver notification. In hindsight, I regret not sending it certified mail and keeping a copy. 

Product Status : XXXX 's argument may be that I should pay for a product or service that I possess. I do NOT have XXXX on my computer. I use XXXX. 
o If I received a software product from XXXX, I could not "" return '' it using any method that I as a common user could technically perform. I immediately deleted any program with the XXXX or XXXX term.

XXXX XXXX insisted that I owed the debt because I did not give XXXX 30 day notice before I left my former apartment. I explained that my lease did not include an notice requirement unless you became a "" holdover tenant. '' Section XXXX applies to "" XXXX tenancy. '' A person becomes a hold over tenant once that remain in possession of the unit beyond the expiration of their lease. I vacated the unit and gave notice to the landlord in the last month of my lease, prior to the expiration. Therefore, I was not a holdover tenant and this section does not apply to me. 

XXXX XXXX sent me a "" notice intention to vacate, '' that was purportedly signed by me, which I never signed. I repeatedly explained to XXXX XXXX that I was not required to give notice under my lease, as long as I vacated the unit before the expiration of my lease. XXXX XXXX never showed me a provision in the lease that stated that I was required to give 30 day notice other than the provision that governs hold over tenants. Then she told me : Try again, you 're trying very hard to find a way out and I assure you, there is none. Your evidence is attached ( meaning the notice of intention to vacate with my falsified signature ). This is your signed and dated notice to vacate. I will schedule the account for credit reporting on you and XXXX XXXX if this is not going to be resolved today.

I contacted Navient why and how they could possibly charge "" late fees '' when I have been in Forbearance the whole time.

I am also astounded that they can charge 8.5 % interest on loans! nobody has see those kind of rates since the 1980 'S! but at least back then we were making good money and the economy was robust. I guess they forgot the "" ro '' in robust and are just going for the bust.

When I called to pay by phone, they had told me that Navient took my debt back and sold it to another debt collector. I asked how that could be, and the man could not answer me. 

When I called Navient they said XXXX had never disclosed to them about my payment plan. When I called back XXXX, they blamed Navient and said they had told Navient about my payment plan and Navient still voided it.

The first time I called each one apologized for the mix-up and blamed the other. When XXXX told me to call back because they would try to speak to Navient to fix the issue or see what they could, the man began to speak aggressively towards me and tried to deny everything he had said previously, in terms of claiming, that Navient was not supposed to cancel my payment plan from XXXX : a supposedly separate debt collection agency.Yet, he admitted that he had reported the mistake to Navient as a managerial complaint, but Navient was ignoring him.

3519,"I, XXXX XXXX, hereby file a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on a law firm that is trying to obtain a wage garnishment on a judgment illegally filed against me in XX/XX/XXXX. I attach copies of my complaint with the Office of Attorney General, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, stating that the original law firm that obtained this judgment obtained this judgment illegally. Since XX/XX/XXXX, the Federal Trade Commission has been active pursuing hundreds of collection agencies that obtain and enforce illegal judgment procedures and subsequently wage garnishments against American consumers illegally. The ethical procedures were simply not followed in my case, and the documentation process on ownership of a debt were not followed by Palisades Collection LLC. 

The Federal Trade Commission, as the main consumer protective federal agency now has under its supervision another federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This complaint will be forwarded to this agency as part of my request for a true investigative process. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, ( 15 USC 1692 et seq. ), which became effective in XXXX XXXX, was designed to eliminate abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices. The Federal Trade Commission, by federal court action was able to establish a firm collection process for all citizens under FTC v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). As part of a federal lawsuit for a collection agency using abusive collection practices, the following directive was established for debt mitigation for any licensed collection agency against consumers. That mandate is as follows : A consumer, if given notice of a collection process must be made aware of the original creditor. The balance must be certain along with any applied interest and penalties based upon the original contractual agreement signed upon by the credit obligator. 

If the debt was assigned for collection, the fact that a validation request was sent to the credit obligator is not relevant unless the collector shows proof of debt assignment from the original creditor. There are no exceptions to this stipulation. As in my lawsuit, I have no knowledge of who the original creditor was, nor given any proof of a legal transfer, either for debt collection purposes or if purchased by a debt buyer. In all aspects of my complaint, there has never been proof of a connection from any original creditor to Palisades Collection, LLC. There can not be a connection by electronic transfer through a debt pooling agreement, and there can be no robo-signature procurement, as the validity of such an arrangement is purely a federal and state violation of my rights in legal collection activities. 

The debt, if established valid by the XXXX previously mentioned criteria, can not be enforced if deemed no longer collectible by Commonwealth of Massachusetts statutes. On this issue there is also no exception. 

From my research, Palisades Collection LLC is not licensed as a debt collector or debt buyer. There is great ambiguity as to what Palisades Collection is pertaining to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Banks. "" A debt buyer purchases debt that is already in default and attempts to collect on the purchased debt. A debt buyer must be licensed as a debt collector by the Division of Banks. Debt buyers are subject to the Commonwealth collection laws and regulations. '' My complaint shows serious violations of my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and legal precedents on proper debt collection procedures with the Attorney General 's Office in Massachusetts. "" I believe that in my original lawsuit there consisted of little more than a summary electronic data file from the debt buyer. I have been given no proof of meaningful account-level documentation!!!",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

Little did I know, this was the start of a 3 year battle trying to see that report. 
From that day forward, I have been trying to get help getting my credit report. Getting a HUMAN on the phone with these credit agencies is nearly impossible.

Now let 's talk about why the website option is not helpful. When I first called to follow up regarding my credit and the fraud with the agencies 3 years ago, that was the first place they directed me to Request my credit report - through the website. So I do that and after putting in all of my information and answering the questions and after I hit "" Submit '' a message of some variation of this would follow : '' We can not identify your account based on the information you provided, please call or mail the following information to this address '' or "" ERROR -- we can not access this page. Please call this number XXXX ''. There is some type of block on my account that does not allow ANYONE to access it within the system. That is why whenever I try to get help online, I am always blocked before getting to the next step because my information appears invalid and then I am directed to call a number. And when I get someone on the phone and they try to help, they always come to a dead end where they can not access any information for me about my account because some type of error pops up that blocks them out. 
I have called each of the agencies countless of times through the years, filled out forms, requests, complaints, mailed in packages of personal information including tax returns, utility bills I pay, my rent bill, a copy of my social security card, my license, passport, XXXX, however I always get the same notice and response -- that they can not identify me and to please send more information or call some other number.

Whomever I spoke with, I asked where they get their information. The quite young man I spoke with told me sometimes they call the other credit bureaus and get their information that way. Is that legal.? 

My main complaints, however, include the fact that XXXX of the XXXX credit bureaus have me listed as having lived at a former address that is actually the address of a former creditor of mine. This should be quite obvious since the address is listed in XXXX Texas, on XXXX XXXX, at XXXX XXXX. It is obviously a commercially zoned address, but that does n't seem to matter. 

Other issues include items listed on my report that have been paid in full in previous years, and XXXX other issue includes an argument I am having with XXXX credit bureaus over a somewhat complicated issue. 

In this case, the creditor in question, Navient, provided me with paperwork to submit to their insurance company to let the insurance company determine whether or not in its eyes, I was indeed XXXX enough not to have further responsibility for the remaining loan amount. Understand that due to my XXXX, I have been on total, XXXX per Social Security since XXXX, XXXX. 

Now I understand that just because Social Security feels a person is totally, XXXX, this does not mean that the Dept of Ed or any private student loan lender has to agree with Social Security 's XXXX status. 

But the Dept of Ed discharged all of my Federal student loans due to my XXXX, and Navient 's insurance company, XXXX, also agreed that I was too XXXX to have further responsibility for the outstanding loan debt. Even so, XXXX told me they would report their XXXX decision to Navient, but that it was still up to Navient to make a final decision as to whether or not to release me from further debt responsibility on the private student loans I had with them. 

Navient did determine to release me from all further responsibility for the remaining debt, making my co-signer, my husband, solely responsible for the outstanding student loan debt on my account ( like that 's going to give me and my husband any financial relief! ). 

Anyway, my husband has been making the Navient loan payments since about XXXX, XXXX, yet Navient has still not removed this debt from my credit report. It looks, on my credit report, as if I, too, am still responsible for some {$40000.00} in Navient debt. 

I have written to them about this error. XXXX XXXX, XXXX has written to Navient about this error, and yet Navient just keeps on sending back "" form '' letters stating their records are correct, and yes, the Navient debt will remain on my credit report. 

WHY? I have absolutely NO further responsibility for this debt. None. And with the added outstanding Navient debt listed on my credit report, it appears as if I am some $ XXXX in debt, if the Navient debt is included, which in my opinion it should not be.

XXXX is the number XXXX XXXX school in the country and costs close to {$60000.00} per year in tuition, fees and housing. As you can see, financial assistance is in almost every case necessary and I was n't born into a wealthy family. However over the course of my adult life I have taken steps to turn the tides on my family 's financial situation. So, with excellent credit, I had no need for a cosigner when I first borrowed money from Discover Student Loans in XX/XX/XXXX. Now, in XX/XX/XXXX, the only thing that has changed for my credit is the nearly {$80000.00} I have borrowed from Discover to pay for my first two years of school via their self-described student loan program. 

With less than 60 days before my next XXXX payment is due and after close to two years of financing me, Discover suddenly decided I am in need of a cosigner. For some students this would be a non-issue, but for me it 's a devastating conclusion. None of my friends, family or extended family have been able to get approved through Discover to be a cosigner. Not only that, but they were refused for Parent Plus loans through the university. I have utilized all of my available subsidized, un-subsidized loans and Federal XXXX XXXX options amounting to about {$8400.00} per semester ; and was depending on Discover to finance the balance, as they did in my first year-and-a-half, to cover XXXX 's tuition of approximately {$60000.00} per year. 

There should be no reason why a student with good credit history, who is only indebted by Discover Student Loans who agreed to lend them money in the first place, should be denied the funds to finish his or her education. With two years left to go for my XXXX degree and this last-minute demand for a consigner, I find myself too late for scholarship deadlines and with no financial options. Without my XXXX degree and the earning power it would provide me, it will be a struggle to even begin to repay the money already borrowed from Discover. 

I would like to see Discover Student Loans bound by 4-year degree contracts with their clients that state Discover Student Loans can not terminate financing until a degree is completed or the four years concludes, whichever comes first. Regardless of the need for a cosigner, Discover should not be able to plunge a student into debt by trying to renegotiate their contract midway through and without the promise of a degree. 

Discover has the right to change its policies but should not change things up arbitrarily and suddenly for students who are proven good customers and who they know have no other options. Imagine buying a house or a car and only getting half of the loan necessary so you ca n't actually buy the house or car but still have to pay the bank for something you never actually received.

When I recovered I contacted Navient the customer service to speak with them regarding payment options. The representative advised me that there is an adverse notation that was sent to the credit bureaus however, what she was going to do was back date my foreberance to cover the late payments so that I would be in good standing with Navient. According to customer service my Foreberance was to start XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. which would cover the time of the missing payments. The representative also advised that she will send a notation to the credit bureau stating that I was current and up to date so that they can remove the adverse remark on my credit report. I was more than satisfied with my customer service experience with the representative but then it took a turn for the worst. A month later I checked my report and I noticed that. Information was sent to the credit bureaus regarding me not being behind in my payments as promised but, the negative notation was still reflecting on my report. I called customer service and explained to them about the conversation that I had with the representative and I was told that I should write a letter with my supporting documents and I will receive information with in ten business days. I did exactly as instructed and fax over the documentation still no response. I call back and I was advised that I needed to wait thirty days and the representative advise me that according to the documentation I submitted that it should be enough to substantiate my request. I sent a good faith request and supporting documents. i also advised Navient in the letter I am in the process of purchasing an apartment. I waited. I then received a denial of my request letter. I was disappointed because I know what I was told and i was assured that this would be taken care of and it was n't. So after i received my response. I reached out to customer service to request to have documentation on the start and the end date of my foreberance which covered the period of XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. the representative at that time said no problem she would put in a request to have that letter sent to me but it would take 30 days. I said fine I waited for the forberance notice to come in the mail. When it does come the notice states that no foreberance would granted at this time, which was wrong because 1, I did n't request a forberance I have been making payments since my forberance ended in XXXX and 2, My request was to receive the documentation from Navient stating the time period of the forbearance that was granted to me from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. So then very frustrated at this point. I called again and spoke to a representative who advised me that they would send me the documentation that requested once again. I explained to them the importance of me receiving this information and I do not trust that that they will handle my request in a timely fashion and time is going.

They have provided inaccurate or misleading information since beginning my payments post graduation. This has caused extreme financial hardship along with limited options available for me to pursue a career. I have never missed a payment through extreme measure taken by family and I and feel their treatment was unjust. 
I financed part of my college education through private loans. I had to because I was unable to receive full financial services through federal loans due to both of my parents each working a full and part time raising their income over the threshold for full federal assistance. I graduated from XXXX University XX/XX/2012 and began making my payments on time 6 months after graduation. In that time, I attempted to develop a plan to repay a debt that had grown substantially over the years due to high interest rates. I had studied to become a teacher and had a desire to peruse a career in XXXX. I soon came to the realization that I would not be able to sustain living on my own and making my college loan payments. I was fortunate enough to be able to move back in with my parents and rely on family to assist me with monthly bills I could not meet. I was willing and applied to position outside of the XXXX area but could not accept them because of these student loans. 
When I reached out to the XXXX XXXX who was the servicer at the time I inquired if consolidation or any other options were available to make my repayments more affordable. The representatives repeatedly told me that these options did not exist and that there was nothing they could do. My older siblings had been able to consolidate but when I asked the answer I received was that those options no longer existed. With no other options my father was forced to withdrawal money from his XXXX savings in order to pay off my XXXX highest interest rates loans. The minimum payments I was making were not even stopping the growth of the debt. These XXXX loan interest rates were 11.625 %, 13.875 %, 14.875 % and 12.125 %. These rates were given to me even with a co-signer. This action resulted in my father being unable to retire and he is still currently employed full time. Only after this extreme measure was taken did XXXX XXXX acknowledge that they were willing to discuss repayment options. Their primary objective most likely being to prolong my loans and make more money now that my highest interest earning loans had been removed, I was incredible upset but thought that there was nothing I could do. 
From that point I attempted to stay in public education full time and work part time jobs as well in order to try and pay down my debt and was able to pay off one more loan in full. In that time XXXX XXXX switched my provider to Navient. After three and half years of trying to make it work I decided that my pursuit of working in public education would never enable me the freedom of finally paying of my student loans. I am now married and work in the public sector, my wife and I still continue to struggle making our loan payments but I know if I had been provided better information from the start from XXXX XXXX I would be in better financial shape today. If they would have offered me repayment options from the start my career might have taken a different path and I would still be in my desired field. They took away my ability choice a desired path while being responsible with payments and debt obligations.

We continued to struggle make payments for the past 15 years, but made all our payments except only had to take a forbearance once due to a job loss. We struggled without savings and without retirement knowing we were getting close to the 20 year forbearance. Now our loans are with Navient and things are not any better. When we called recently to find out exactly how many more years we had to pay until our loans were forgiven, they said "" oh you are not eligible for forgiveness because you are not enrolled in that program. We can enroll you in that program now if you like, and in 20 years you will have forgiveness as long as you are in good standing. '' Not only do we face 20 more years of payments, and no more savings, or retirement, but our kids are now faced with taking loans for school and more. The cycle never ends with the deceptive practices. Never once did we assume our loans would not be forgiven after 20 years of payments, and especially since the principal amount of the loans has been paid, but due to the way the system works the wording and the structure of their repayment assistance you never payoff your loans and you keep paying more and more interest. We are now faced with our payments going from {$650.00} to over {$900.00} for the next 20 years, even though we have paid over {$110000.00} to date, which was the amount of our original loans. According to Navient we will now pay the same amount in interest as we had in original loans, and we will have done so over 40 years. This practice is unfair for those who have made payments for decades and continue to do so, only to find out that our remaining loans would not be forgiven after 20 years. Never were we advised about having to be in a special program for forgiveness after 20 years, actually the only willingness the groups are readily able to do is lower your payment, but never telling you the long term ramifications. This is worse than the housing market scams, I am not looking for any special penalties or refunds, or monetary damage. At this point I would like to just have my the remainder of my loans forgiven. That is only fair. I have paid over the original loan amount since I started paying, but apparently that only goes to interest. Doing simple math even though we paid more that this, we owed {$110000.00} originally, and we paid about {$600.00} per month for 15-17 years at least.

In the attached letter, a collection agency is very cutely trying to show that they are trying to collect a monthly withholding tax, which is ludicrous enough. The Federal Trade Commission realized that trying to maintain a reasonable collection system in the country is impossible without legislative measures from Congress, an act that has been voided since Congress is moved only by lobbyist from various banking concerns and the thousands of collection agencies nationwide that can not be regulated. However, this collection by an entity known as The Allen Daniel Associates , Inc. is so corrupt and a threat against me personally or my driver 's license, that this agency should be permanently barred from acquiring information from the XXXX Department of Revenue. It may be possible that the XXXX has no idea that such a collection activity even exists, or that this state agency in in collusion with a collection practice that steps far beyond Fair Debt Collection Practices Act guidelines. One thing is certain, the corporation has been closed for far more than one year, and that there was never a withholding tax instituted by the XXXX of XXXX. I demand that all demands for payment cease and desist by this small-time collection agency known as The Allen Daniel Associates , Inc., and that this information from the XXXX of XXXX Department of Revenue be purged permanently. There is legal precedent on my side, and this threat by a collection agency on fictitious numbers and on claims that can no longer be legally enforced is a disgrace to the measures enforced by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - 2009 ) I demand that this collection agency be sanctioned by the CFPB and that the XXXX of XXXX be warned that these threats of illegal collection actions be shut down immediately.

3790,"I am a student at XXXX. ( XXXX ) and although I am XXXX XXXX, the school has not provided accommodations. As a result, my condition worsened. I discussed my options with the school and called "" FedLoan Servicing '' about my grace period where I was told that if I drop below half time enrollment the 6 month grace period starts and then resets the moment I return to half time enrollment. 

So I dropped a class XX/XX/XXXX taking me just below half time and returned to full time status in the XXXX. I attended every class, and did all homework. Unfortunately, I still was n't quite well yet, and started having XXXX which I saw a medical professional about XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that if I dropped at that time there would be a full refund and that I would be eligible for student loans in the summer. Based on this, and what I was told about grace periods, I felt safe dropping the semester XX/XX/XXXX intending to continue again in the XXXX. 

FedLoan Servicing instead sent me a letter telling me that my grace period ends XX/XX/XXXX, which would be the case if the grace period never reset in XX/XX/XXXX, but the grace period should end XX/XX/XXXX. This is a big deal, because the XXXX semester starts XX/XX/XXXX, and instead of resting as I am supposed to be, I 'm XXXX over what should be a simple issue. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I sent FedLoan servicing documents from my school showing the date that I fell below half time was last XX/XX/XXXX and I quoted back to them their policy : "" If you go back to a Department of Education approved school at least half-time before your Grace Period ends, you will get another six-month Grace Period the next time you leave school. '' I explained that either my grace period should end later, or they lied to me when presenting this policy. They told me the matter would be reviewed and I would get a letter 7 to 10 days later. I waited 16 days, sent another email asking why I have n't heard back from them, then today - XX/XX/XXXX - they said that on XX/XX/XXXX they checked my current status which said I am not currently enrolled. In other words, they did n't even try to investigate the actual matter. They tell me that the school has to update my status as active for them to do anything, which is simply not true. I am not currently enrolled in classes and that should n't matter. 

All I expect them to do is follow the rules they provided me in advance of making decisions about my loans. Either the grace period is set to end XX/XX/XXXX, or they committed fraud by withholding important information from me. Either way, I will be taking classes again starting XX/XX/XXXX and I want grace period issues to be corrected. 

The only reason why I have not already registered for summer classes is because I am still paying the school back for the XX/XX/XXXX semester, and I have to have it all paid back before I can enroll in classes again. It 's especially strange to owe the school money for the loans that FedLoan Servicing denies exists.

3945,"I have recently contacted ACS Education Services to discuss available options regarding my monthly payment. While I am current on my monthly payments I explained my current financial situation and my concern to fulfill my future monthly obligations. Ultimately, I expressed my intentions to be proactive prior to accumulating missed payments in the future then continuing to fall further behind. Each representative had expressed similarly that they can appreciate my effort to reframe from missing future payments, yet there are no additional repayment options available for me. They continued to explain that if I was currently 31 days or more past due other options would be available at that time. If they are capable of offering other payment options after 31 days past due, they certainly can make those same options available to those that are struggling to avoid late payments. Therefore, after different attempts to voice my concern with various representatives, ACS Education Services will still not provide me with an alternative repayment option to avoid missing payments due to my financial situation. 
Since graduating in 2013, each of my federal and private student loans has now transferred to repayment status. I have continued to place my federal loans in forbearance in order to afford the private loans and other monthly expenses. After graduation, the income I accumulated from my employment was insufficient to pay for each private student loan I acquired over my collegiate years. Therefore, I was compelled to utilize the brief forbearance period allowed which is no longer available. Over the last few years, I have been blessed to obtain advancements in my career, which have generated increased wages. Even though my income has increased, the payment obligation for each monthly expense and student loan continues to exceed my total monthly income. Currently I receive about XXXX a month after taxes. My total expense which include current student loans being repaid is about XXXX. If I forgo other monthly expenses and limit my grocery/personal budget, the total expenses could be reduced to about XXXX. Even if the forbearance option was available, I would prefer not to delay my obligations. In conclusion, I would greatly benefit from lowering my monthly private student loan payment.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

XXXX and XXXX were able to update these items to paid in a timely manner with no help from me. Experian, however seems to have some kind of difficulty actually checking public records to see if they match their records, as they have twice refused to update these XXXX items to paid status. This amounts to willful noncompliance with FCRA. Under the law, if the furnisher of information can not or will not update the information to correct errors the information must be deleted. FCRA 607 ( b ) - Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. 
Experian and/or Experian 's paid agent ( their furnisher of public information items ) has failed to follow the requirement of 607 ( b ) TWICE. Clearly Experian is unable or unwilling to verify this information.

Since Experian and/or their paid agent have failed to properly verify a public record that has been verified by XXXX and XXXX, I can only assume they are being willfully non-compliant. Because these XXXX items not being listed as paid makes me ineligible for a mortgage I have been significantly harmed by this action.

The loss of the ability to obtain a mortgage harms me greatly, far in excess of {$1000.00}. 

Experian and/or their paid agent ( the furnisher ) must immediately update or delete the entries if they can not /will not verify them. Failure of them to do so for a third time will result in my pursuing legal action against them for willful non-compliance.

Here is another email I sent : Dear XXXX, Thank you for your inquiry and for your business with Navient. 
Because the monthly payment amount fluctuates as the variable interest rate of your loans changes, the amortization of your loans will also change, rendering the previous information inaccurate. In addition, the application of payments to principal and interest is not predetermined. This means that since interest accrues daily on the unpaid balance, the number of days between payments determines the amount applied to interest from each payment. For this reason, we do not provide amortization schedules.

4034,"In continuation of case XXXX [ remove before publishing ] : Discover Student Loans is continuing to report each scheduled and agreed-to auto-draft payment I make to them as a "" missed payment '' to the credit bureaus. This dramatically damages me as a consumer since my credit scores are significantly impacted by "" percentage of on time payments '' in my credit history. Discover Student Loan 's "" missed payments '' appear as the sole negative activities on my credit history since my bankruptcy was discharged, and represent to inquirers proof that whatever money management issues they speculate me to have had before the bankruptcy, continue into the present day. 

This is factually false as a "" missed payment '' is defined as a payment that was never made by the consumer despite an agreement between the parties to make it. It is also damaging that each payment I make on time actually hurts my credit history more. This is the first problem. 

Discover defends this reporting on the technicality that because I declared bankruptcy while the loans were with XXXX, the loans automatically enter "" charge-off '' status under XXXX before they were sold to Discover, and that each payment is then considered simply a reduction in the delinquent amount, regardless if the account had ever been delinquent or not. 

The loans are already reported as "" charge-off '' by XXXX however. This means that each of these loans is reported on my credit twice as charged off, damaging my score twice for only XXXX charge-off account as if XXXX account was charged off by XXXX and another by Discover student loans. This is the second problem. 

Ever since Discover acquired the loans however, I have made each payment "" as agreed '' by its very definition- payment arrangements were made between myself and Discover upon acquisition, successfully drafted each month, and the agreements were renewed annually. Therefore, the accounts with Discover should show as "" Paid as Agreed '' and the accounts should only show as "" charged off '' by XXXX who were the only lenders to charge the debts off. 

Just today I made ahead-of-schedule arrangements to pay off the remaining balances in full, and the final payment to XXXX account. However I was told that even these ahead-of-schedule payments to pay off the accounts in full will only add to the number of so-called "" missed payments '' on my credit report. While eliminating delinquent debt which reflects well on me to one who reviews my history closely, my face-value credit score will actually suffer a worse punishment for these early payments by adding to the number and increasing the percentage of so-called "" missed '' or "" late payments '' even though they are pre-paying the debt to XXXX the balance completely. 

Furthermore, these credit agencies show that the charge-off date is updated each month by Discover student loans to be the last date of update. This then shows that each month the loans are charged off not just through the updated "" charge-off '' date, but also through an illustration of monthly payment history which lists each month as the account being "" charged off. '' This is the third problem. 

My only request is that these payments to Discover student loans and the accounts they hold are reported by them factually correct. That means that the payments which were all made as scheduled without error be labeled as "" on-time '' and that the accounts are marked as "" Paid as agreed '' until the final payments I arranged today are processed. At that time the accounts should be labeled as "" PAID IN FULL '' and every payment preceding them should be shown as "" on time. "" Industry labeling practice technicalities are no excuse for factual misrepresentations of myself, my payments, my financial agreements, and my ability to keep those agreements.

It was at this point that I contacted Navient over the phone to see what could be done, as I am undergoing some extreme financial hardship between supporting myself and paying legal fees. 
In my phone call with the Navient representative ( XX/XX/XXXX ), she mentioned that while Income-based payment plans are an option, that in her PROFESSIONAL OPINION, which I should absolutely trust, I should place my loans on forbearance for an ENTIRE CALENDAR YEAR. She also recommended that after the year was up, if I still did n't want to pay my payments due to hardship, I should renew my forbearance for ANOTHER YEAR. Throughout the conversation she was very reassuring that this was my best option, even after verbally confirming that I spend a decent chunk of my income assisting family members not claimed on my taxes. To lock in my forbearance, she said something along the lines of, "" Okay now I have to read you something and I need you to say you agree and you 're all done! '' Great. She quickly read XXXX paragraphs of terms to me that briefly mentioned I would gain roughly {$30.00} a day in additional fees added to my loans. I was naive and trusted her so I said I agree ( it was my best option, right?? ) Here 's where it gets interesting. In XX/XX/XXXX I get another 'Document Ready to View ' email that now shows my owed amount jumped up to OVER {$5000.00}. I then called Navient again & another representative explained that I took out XXXX federal loans, the second one being for {$3500.00} ( I was n't aware of this ever ). I concluded this jump in principal was due to my account being placed on forbearance and that I IMMEDIATELY wanted to be taken off of forbearance and switched to an income-based payment plan. This new representative said that was fine, but that she recommended I "" hold off on that '' because a link was broken on their website so the application process now involves me having to fax tax documents to them and filling out an application online that may take up to 15 business days to process before I get approved to be removed from forbearance. 
I promptly mentioned that I was aware of the lawsuit filed against Navient for their deceptive practices and that I felt I was being subjected to said deceptions. SHE IMMEDIATELY changed her tone and said "" Oh well I can take you off forbearance right now over the phone let me put you on hold. '' She later came back with a fake surprised tone saying, "" My goodness she pressured you into forbearance for a year? That 's unheard of ; let me fix that.

At no time did the CRAs forward to me any documentation supporting how they veirifed the information & tradelines. I want the items deleted asap because at no time was the company a creditor of mine nor were they working on behalf of a creditor of mine and XXXX & Experian did not & could not conduct a reasonable investigation under the statute without the proper authenticated documents. Also, how could this information be deleted in my XXXX credit file but be verified in my XXXX & Experian credit files & reports.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0

4053,"Dear Sir, My wife and I rented an apartment in XXXX, Texas, which was taken over by new management shortly before we vacated. Under the terms of the contract ( which I no longer have a copy of but requested from the collection agency, who refused to supply it, though admitting they have a copy ), charged us {$510.00} for vacating, including keeping our deposit. 
We left the premises as our contract had expired. I gave one month 's notice, though they asked for two months and refused to check the apartment before we left. We left it in good condition, took everything out, and gave the key to a trusted neighbor. 
I have filed chapter XXXX, but it is affecting my wife 's credit report.

4063,"My documents we submitted by the deadline noticed in the paperwork and my loan payment recertification was completed by the deadline provided. However, after I received my recertification letter my account was placed into forbearance without my permission and without being informed that such action was being taken in regards to my account. This was only discovered when I realized that I did not receive a statement for the month of XXXX. When I called Nelnet, they informed me that they were "" doing me a favor. '' At this point I asked to speak to a supervisor because action was taken on my account without my consent. After much discussion with the supervisor I was informed that my account could only be taken out of forbearance after a payment was made. I immediately made the payment which should have been on the statement that was never sent to me. After informing the supervisor that I made the payment and I would like them to take my account out of forbearance and to not have the interest that was accumulated during this time to be capitalized to my loan amounts since this was done without my permission. Supervisor told me that she could not do this until after the payment posted which would be sometime the next week. I had to follow-up the next week with Nelnet and again ask that the forbearance be taken off my account as it was done without my permission and asked again that the interest during this time not be capitalized. This was finally sorted out and I received a letter afterward that my account was put in forbearance incorrectly! It took HOURS to get this all sorted because Nelnet put my account in forbearance without my permission and without notifying me that they were doing so. This is extremely wrong and they should not be allowed to change someone 's account status without their permission and especially without notifying them of the action they are taking. Also, for the record, I had not missed a payment or done anything which would have justified them in believing that I would n't be able to make my monthly payment.",qa_accounts,asccounts,qa,0
